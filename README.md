 Our project is an interactive web fishing simulator in which user can catch fish by moving fishing rod around in a horde of fish in random motion. User gets score if he or she successfully catches a fish and user can also challenge him- or herself by completing game with game stages of increasing difficulty.  
  
 It consists of two parts:  
 -A welcome page and  
 -The fishing pond

The welcome page gives a brief introduction of how to play the game and presents several types of fishes in the game.  
Welcome page is implemented by constructing a big cube as background and using "text" shape from text-demo to show letters.  
User can press 'B' on the keyboard to enter the fishing pond.  

In the fishing pond, user can see a square pond surrounded by wooden frames, grass and some animals.
